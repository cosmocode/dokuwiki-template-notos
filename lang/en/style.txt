The Notos template uses less color variables than the default template. Those variables are shown in **bold** above.
The non-bold variables are not used by Notos but plugins may rely on their settings, so they should contain reasonable
values. The hints below tell you what you most likely want to add there.

If you want to adjust the logo, simply use the Media Manager to upload a ''logo.png'' into the ''wiki'' namespace and it
will be automatically used. You can also upload a ''favicon.ico'' there. If you use a closed
wiki it is recommended to make the ''wiki'' namespace world readable in the ACL settings or
your logo is not shown to not logged in users.
